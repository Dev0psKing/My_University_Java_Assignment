# EmployeeProcessing Application Documentation

## Overview

The `EmployeeProcessing` application is designed to manage and process employee data. It allows users to input details for multiple employees, then perform various operations such as filtering based on age, calculating average salary, and generating lists of employee information.

## Classes

### Employee

The `Employee` class represents an individual employee and contains the following attributes:

- `name`: `String` - the name of the employee.
- `age`: `int` - the age of the employee.
- `department`: `String` - the department in which the employee works.
- `salary`: `double` - the salary of the employee.

#### Constructor

```java
public Employee(String name, int age, String department, double salary)
```

Creates a new `Employee` object with the specified name, age, department, and salary.

#### Methods

- `getName()`: `String` - returns the name of the employee.
- `getAge()`: `int` - returns the age of the employee.
- `getDepartment()`: `String` - returns the department of the employee.
- `getSalary()`: `double` - returns the salary of the employee.
- `toString()`: `String` - returns a string representation of the employee object.

### EmployeeProcessing

The `EmployeeProcessing` class contains the main method and various utility methods to handle employee data input and processing.

#### Main Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

The entry point of the application. It performs the following tasks:

1. Prompts the user to enter the number of employees.
2. Collects employee details (name, age, department, salary) for each employee.
3. Prompts the user to enter an age threshold.
4. Generates a list of concatenated employee names and departments.
5. Calculates the average salary of all employees.
6. Filters and displays employees whose age is above the specified threshold.

#### Utility Methods

- `getValidInt(Scanner scanner, String errorMessage)`: `int`

  Prompts the user for an integer input and validates it. Returns the valid integer input.

- `getValidDouble(Scanner scanner, String errorMessage)`: `double`

  Prompts the user for a double input and validates it. Returns the valid double input.

- `getValidString(Scanner scanner, String errorMessage)`: `String`

  Prompts the user for a string input and validates it. Returns the valid string input.

- `printFunctionInterfaceSummary()`: `void`

  Prints a summary of the `Function` interface in Java, explaining its purpose and usage in the program.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the `EmployeeProcessing` class.
2. **Enter Employee Data**: Input the number of employees and provide details (name, age, department, salary) for each employee when prompted.
3. **Age Threshold**: Enter an age threshold to filter employees.
4. **Output**:
    - List of concatenated employee names and departments.
    - Average salary of all employees.
    - List of employees whose age is above the specified threshold.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter the number of employees: 2

Enter details for Employee 1:
Name: John Doe
Age: 30
Department: IT
Salary: 50000

Enter details for Employee 2:
Name: Jane Smith
Age: 40
Department: HR
Salary: 60000

Enter age threshold: 35

Name and Department List:
John Doe - IT
Jane Smith - HR

Average Salary: $55000.0

Employees above age 35:
Employee{name='Jane Smith', age=40, department='HR', salary=60000.0}
```

## Summary of Function Interface in Java

The `Function` interface in Java represents a function that takes one argument and produces a result. It is a functional interface defined in the `java.util.function` package and contains the method:

- `R apply(T t)`: Applies this function to the given argument.

In this program, the `Function` interface is used to create a function that takes an `Employee` object and returns a concatenated string of the employee's name and department. Using the `Function` interface, along with streams, helps in processing and manipulating collections in a declarative and concise manner.
